<h3>What is Python</h3>
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It emphasizes code readability with its clean and easy-to-understand syntax, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
<h3>Variables in Python</h3>
Variables in Python are used to store data values. Here's a summary of Python variables:

    Naming Rules:
        Variable names can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
        They cannot start with a digit.
        Python is case-sensitive, so myVar and myvar are different variables.
        Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.

    Assignment:
        Assign values to variables using the assignment operator =.

    Data Types:
        Variables can hold various data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.
        Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Python determines the data type based on the value assigned to it.

    Variable Scope:
        Variables can have local or global scope.
        Variables defined inside a function are local to that function unless declared as global.
        Variables defined outside of any function have global scope.

    Variable Naming Conventions:
        Follow PEP 8 guidelines for naming variables.
        Use lowercase letters for variable names.
        Use underscores to separate words in variable names for better readability (my_variable instead of myvariable).

    Reassignment:
        You can change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it.

    Deleting Variables:
        Use the del statement to delete a variable and free up memory.
<h3>Python datatypes</h3>
Python provides built-in data types to store and manipulate different kinds of data efficiently. Here's a summary of some of the fundamental data types in Python:

    Numeric Types:
        Integers (int): Whole numbers without decimal points.
        Floating-point numbers (float): Numbers with decimal points or in exponential form.

    Sequence Types:
        Lists (list): Ordered collection of items, mutable (modifiable).
        Tuples (tuple): Ordered collection of items, immutable (cannot be modified).
        Strings (str): Ordered collection of characters, immutable.

    Mapping Type:
        Dictionaries (dict): Collection of key-value pairs, unordered, mutable.

    Set Types:
        Sets (set): Unordered collection of unique items, mutable.
        Frozen sets (frozenset): Immutable sets.

    Boolean Type:
        Boolean (bool): Represents truth values True or False.

    None Type:
        None (NoneType): Represents the absence of a value or a null value.

These data types can be used to create complex data structures and solve various programming problems efficiently. Python also allows for type conversion and provides functions and methods to work with these data types effectively.

<h3>Basic Data Structure</h3>
Basic data structures in Python are essential for organizing and storing data efficiently. Here's a summary of some of the fundamental data structures:

    Lists:
        Ordered collection of items.
        Mutable (can be modified).
        Created using square brackets [].
        Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'hello'].

    Tuples:
        Ordered collection of items.
        Immutable (cannot be modified).
        Created using parentheses ().
        Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'hello').

    Dictionaries:
        Collection of key-value pairs.
        Unordered (order of items is not guaranteed).
        Mutable.
        Created using curly braces {}.
        Example: my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}.

    Sets:
        Unordered collection of unique items.
        Mutable (can be modified).
        Created using curly braces {} or the set() constructor.
        Example: my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}.

    Strings:
        Ordered collection of characters.
        Immutable.
        Created using single (') or double (") quotes.
        Example: my_string = "Hello, World!".

These basic data structures can be combined and nested to create more complex data structures to suit various programming needs. Python also provides built-in functions and methods to manipulate and operate on these data structures efficiently.
