<h3>What is Python</h3>
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It emphasizes code readability with its clean and easy-to-understand syntax, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

<h3>Python datatypes</h3>
Python provides built-in data types to store and manipulate different kinds of data efficiently. Here's a summary of some of the fundamental data types in Python:

    Numeric Types:
        Integers (int): Whole numbers without decimal points.
        Floating-point numbers (float): Numbers with decimal points or in exponential form.

    Sequence Types:
        Lists (list): Ordered collection of items, mutable (modifiable).
        Tuples (tuple): Ordered collection of items, immutable (cannot be modified).
        Strings (str): Ordered collection of characters, immutable.

    Mapping Type:
        Dictionaries (dict): Collection of key-value pairs, unordered, mutable.

    Set Types:
        Sets (set): Unordered collection of unique items, mutable.
        Frozen sets (frozenset): Immutable sets.

    Boolean Type:
        Boolean (bool): Represents truth values True or False.

    None Type:
        None (NoneType): Represents the absence of a value or a null value.

These data types can be used to create complex data structures and solve various programming problems efficiently. Python also allows for type conversion and provides functions and methods to work with these data types effectively.
